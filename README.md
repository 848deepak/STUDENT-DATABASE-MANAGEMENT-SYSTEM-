Student Database Management System (SDBMS)

A Student Database Management System (SDBMS) is a software application designed to efficiently manage and organize student-related information within educational institutions. The system includes functionalities to store, retrieve, update, and manage student records, academic data, and course information. The provided C++ implementation focuses on using linked lists for data management and offers a range of features for handling student and course data.

Purpose

The primary objective of the SDBMS is to streamline the handling of student information by automating various administrative tasks. This system ensures that student data, including personal details and academic records, is easily accessible, securely stored, and can be managed with minimal manual intervention.

Key Features

	1.	Student Records Management:
	•	Enrollment Information: Stores details such as enrollment number, name, date of birth, and contact information.
	•	Academic Records: Manages data on grades, sessional and theory marks, and performance across different semesters.
	2.	Course and Scheme Management:
	•	Course Details: Tracks information about courses, including course codes, titles, and descriptions.
	•	Scheme Details: Manages subject schemes, including maximum marks for sessional and theory components.
	3.	Student Enrollment and Updates:
	•	Add/Edit Student: Allows users to add new students and update existing student records.
	•	Delete Student: Provides functionality to remove student records from the database.
	4.	Report Generation:
	•	Print Report Card: Generates and prints report cards based on a student’s academic performance.
	•	Performance Reports: Creates reports on student performance, including time measurements for different operations.
	5.	Data Validation:
	•	Date of Birth Validation: Ensures that the date of birth is entered in the correct format (DD-MM-YYYY) and is valid.
	•	Data Integrity: Checks for errors and inconsistencies in student records.
	6.	Performance Measurement:
	•	Time Measurement: Measures the time taken for operations such as adding or updating student records to optimize performance.
	7.	Sorting and Filtering:
	•	Sorting: Allows sorting of student records based on fields such as name or enrollment number.
	•	Filtering: Enables users to filter records based on specified criteria.
	8.	Logging and Tracking:
	•	Action Logging: Logs actions performed in the system, such as adding, updating, or deleting records, for auditing and tracking purposes.
	9.	Display Records:
	•	Display All Students: Provides functionality to display records of all students in the database, facilitating easy retrieval and review of student information.

Implementation Details

	•	Data Structure: The system uses doubly linked lists to manage student and scheme records, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
	•	Programming Language: Implemented in C++, utilizing features like linked lists, file operations, and data validation.
	•	User Interface: Offers a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, where users can perform operations through menus and prompts.
	•	Data Storage: Data is stored in text files for logging actions and can be extended to store student records persistently.

Example Use Cases

	1.	Adding a Student: An administrator inputs student details, which are added to the system. The student is assigned an enrollment number, and their records are maintained in the database.
	2.	Generating a Report Card: For a specific student, the system retrieves academic performance data and generates a report card that can be printed or saved.
	3.	Updating a Scheme: If course requirements change, the system allows updating the course scheme details, which are reflected in the grading records.
	4.	Displaying Records: The system provides an option to display all student records, making it easy for administrators to view and manage student information.
	5.	Measuring Performance: The system measures how long it takes to perform various operations, aiding in performance optimization.

Benefits

	•	Efficiency: Automates administrative tasks, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
	•	Accessibility: Provides quick and easy access to student and course information.
	•	Scalability: Handles an increasing number of student and course records effectively.
	•	Security: Ensures that sensitive student information is securely stored and accessed only by authorized users.

An SDBMS, as implemented in the provided C++ code, is essential for effective management of educational data, supporting various administrative functions within educational institutions.
